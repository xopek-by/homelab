# Max's Homelab

Welcome to my personal Homelab repository! This repository contains various projects that I use, have used, or plan to use in my Homelab. 
At the moment I have a Lenovo P520 running as a server and I am experimenting a lot. Use with caution, I am not responsible for your data. But feel free to explore and use the resources provided to enhance your home lab setup. 

- **Docker Projects**: Pre-configured Docker containers for different applications and services. Sample configuration files for this services.
- **Scripting & Automation**: Useful scripts for automation and management tasks, Ansible playbooks.

Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
